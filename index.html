    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>About me:<p>
    <p>Hi, I’m Kennesha! I’m a recent graduate with a Bachelor’s in Health Informatics from Georgia State University with an Associate’s in Business Technology from Gwinnett Technical College. I was lucky enough to be part of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, which inspired me to always aim high and put my best foot forward in everything I do.</p>

Though I’m just starting my career, I’m excited to apply what I’ve learned about data analysis, medical records management, compliance, and reporting in real-world settings. I’ve gained hands-on experience with tools like SQL, Power BI, Tableau, EPIC, Alteryx, and Microsoft Office—all of which I’m eager to dive deeper into. I’m the type of person who loves solving problems and finding better ways to do things, and I’m always up for a challenge.</p>

As I continue to grow in the field, I’m committed to learning, gaining experience, and eventually pursuing my master’s degree to sharpen my skills further. My goal is to contribute to any team I’m part of and to keep improving as I take on new opportunities.</p>
